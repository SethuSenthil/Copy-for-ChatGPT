# Copy for ChatGPT
The purpose of this extention is to copy output given from ChatGPT with just a click of a button or through a keyboard command (CMD+K on Mac or CTRL+K on Windows)
## This is still in development, I made this quickly before I went to bed ðŸ’€

## Known Bugs
CMD+K shortcut does not work properly in some situations (because of outdated document references when page is navigated)
Emoji is boxed out on some computers (since emoji font is not available, fix: to replace to image)
Enhancement: Check convo length for changes before traversing through convo (removed in current version due to document reference inconsistency)

# How to add extension
Download Source
Load unpacked extension
Will publish on Chrome store once done
